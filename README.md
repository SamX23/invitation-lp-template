## About this project

I create this repository for a project of landing page invitation template, as nowadays, people use digital invitation as a way to show their ceremony, happiness and documentation in a single landing page. Not only a basic landing page, but the landing page has a lot of feature such as music background, animation, grid gallery, and other interactive elements. So, I asked myself why do I don't create one ?

The project must be :
- Using Cleancode
- Using CI/CD (about to)
- Using React
- Using React-bootstrap
- Using styled-component
- Firebase (or another)
- Hosted on Firebase or Vercel
- Good lighthouse result (satisfying for me)
- Scallable and highly customizable
